>This repo contains educational material for the robotics course at Kuben Upper Secondary School.
The material is aimed to be a resource for teachers and students, and contains a detailed plan with clear goals and strategy for implementation of the course. Material covering cooperation with other courses are also included.

The Norwegian acronym AMOR stands for: "Anvendt Matematikk og Robotikk" and translates to "Applied Mathemathics and Robotics". 

Due to lack of funding 2019/2020, the course will hopefully start up for the first time fall of 2021 for the school year 2021/2022.
